# Facial-Recognition-and-Attendence-Sysytem

# Description:

This project is a facial recognition and attendance system implemented in Python using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to recognize faces in images or live video streams, match them against a database of known faces, and then mark attendance based on the recognized faces.

**Key Features:**
- Face Detection: The system uses a face detection algorithm to locate and extract faces from images or video frames.
- Face Recognition: It employs a face recognition model to compare the extracted faces against a database of known faces and determine if there is a match.
- Attendance Marking: Upon successful recognition, the system marks the attendance of the recognized individual in a database or log file.
- User Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system, including options for adding new faces to the database and viewing attendance records.
- Database Management: The system manages a database of known faces, allowing for easy addition, deletion, and modification of records.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python: The core programming language used for implementing the system's functionality.
- OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning library used for face detection and recognition.
- TensorFlow/Keras: Used for training and deploying the face recognition model.
- SQLite: A lightweight database management system used for storing the database of known faces and attendance records.
- Tkinter: A GUI toolkit for creating the user interface of the system.

This project serves as a practical example of how facial recognition technology can be applied to automate attendance marking in various settings, such as classrooms, workplaces, or events. The system is customizable and can be further enhanced with additional features, such as facial expression recognition or integration with access control systems.
